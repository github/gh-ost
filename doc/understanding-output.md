# Understanding gh-ost output

`gh-ost` attempts to be verbose to the point where you really know what it's doing, without completely spamming you.
You can control output levels:
- `--verbose`: common use. Useful output, not tons of it
- `--debug`: everything. Tons of output.

Initial output lines may look like this:
```

```
Those are relatively self explanatory. Mostly they indicate that all goes well.

You will be mostly interested in following up on the migration and understanding whether it goes well. Once migration actually begins, you will see output as follows:

```

```
In the above some time was spent on counting table rows. `29s` have elapsed before actual rowcopy began. `gh-ost` will not deliver ETA before `1%` of the copy is complete.

```

In the above migration is throttled on occasion.

- A few times because one of the control replicas, specifically `my.replica-01.com:3306`, was lagging
- Once because `max-load` threshold has been reached (`Threads_running=26 >= 25`)
- Once because the migration replica itself (the server into which `gh-ost` connected) lagged.

`gh-ost` will always specify the reason for throttling.

### Progress

- `Copy: 595700/752865 79.1%` indicates the number of existing table rows copied onto the _ghost_ table, out of an estimate of the total row count.
- `Applied: 0` indicates the number of entries processed in the binary log and applied onto the _ghost_ table. In the examples above there was no traffic on the migrated table, hence no rows processed.

A migration on a more intensively used table may look like this:

```

```

Notes:

- `Applied: 381910`: `381910` events in the binary logs presenting changes to the migrated table have been processed and applied on the _ghost_ table since beginning of migration.
- `Backlog: 0/100`: we are performing well on reading the binary log. There's nothing known in the binary log queue that awaits processing.
- `Backlog: 7/100`: while copying rows, a few events have piled up in the binary log _modifying our table_ that we spotted, and still need to apply.
- `Backlog: 100/100`: our buffer of `100` events is full; you may see this during or right after throttling (the binary logs keep filling up with relevant queries that are not being processed), or immediately following a high workload.
  `gh-ost` will always prioritize binlog event processing (backlog) over row-copy; when next possible (throttling completes, in our example), `gh-ost` will drain the queue first, and only then proceed to resume row copy.
  There is nothing wrong with seeing `100/100`; it just indicates we're behind at that point in time.
- `Copy: 31291200/43138418`, `Copy: 31389700/43138432`: this migration executed with `--exact-rowcount`. `gh-ost` continuously heuristically updates the total number of expected row copies as migration proceeds, hence the change from `43138418` to `43138432`
- `streamer: mysql-bin.006793:179473435` tells us which binary log entry is `gh-ost` processing at this time.

### Status hint

In addition, once every `10` minutes, a friendly reminder is printed, in the following form:

```
# Migrating `mydb`.`mytable`; Ghost table is `mydb`.`_mytable_gst`
# Migrating mysql.master-01.com:3306; inspecting mysql.replica-05.com:3306; executing on some.host-17.com
# Migration started at Mon Jul 25 01:13:19 2016
# chunk-size: 500; max lag: 1000ms; max-load: Threads_running=25; critical-load: Threads_running=1000; nice-ratio: 0
# throttle-additional-flag-file: /tmp/gh-ost.throttle.flag.file
# postpone-cut-over-flag-file: /tmp/gh-ost.postpone.flag.file [set]
# panic-flag-file: /tmp/gh-ost.panic.flag.file
# Serving on unix socket: /tmp/gh-ost.mydb.mytable.sock
```

- The above mostly print out the current configuration. Remember you can [dynamically control](interactive-commands.md) most of them.
- `gh-ost` notes that the `postpone-cut-over-flag-file` file actually exists by printing `[set]`
